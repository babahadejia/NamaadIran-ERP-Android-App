Author: Shahrooz Sabet, shahrooz.sabet@gmail.com, 2014/04/09

This app is developed with Xamarin Cross platform development framework for implementing an ERP application in Android devices and having an eye to support IOS and Windows devices in future.

This app is built in a modular way in order to improve collaboration between all the teams in development of the ERP system. This means that all the UI menu and forms are stored in the builtin SQLite DB.

The DB can be updated via BasicHttp autentication WCF web service call from the server.

This app currently has one form for issuing Sale factor. Integrated Barcode Scanning is supported.

For future work is planned to use DLL instead of simply call form classes in order to build different ERP modules form and UI.
