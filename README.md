NamaadIran ERP Android App, Xamarin, GNU GPL v3
----
----

This app is developed with Xamarin.Android Cross platform development framework 
for implementing an ERP application in Android devices and having an eye 
to support IOS and Windows devices in future.

This app is built in a modular way in order to improve collaboration between all the teams in development of the ERP system. 
This means that all the UI menu and forms are stored in the builtin SQLite DB, like Namaad Iran ERP itself.

The DB can be updated via BasicHttp authentication WCF web service call from the server.

For future work is planned to use DLL instead of simply call form classes in order to build different ERP modules form and UI.

This app currently has two systems in the ERP:

* Sale system:
----

Just one form for issuing Sale factor in the Sale system is built

* Building managment system(BMS):
----
NBMS(Namaad co. BMS) branch is developed. 


Major Features :
----

1. Modular application (Same approach as Namaad Iran ERP apps)
2. Integrated Barcode Scanning is supported.
