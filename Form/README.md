This folder contains a folder for each system with a 3 characters of the system's name,

e.g. "BMS" would be folder name for BMS system related UI and forms.

IF contributer want to add a System, he/she should create a folder here and then adds its
activity there, and then insert a record in the menu table. so programmer can focuse just on functionality
of the program and the framework show the UI.
